            <h4>What is Growing Database Schemas ?</h4>
                <p>
                    Growing Database Schemas is a web application, which takes one SQL query at a time and builds the 
                    global database schema on which that query can be run. And at each subsequent query updates the schema to make it grow.
                </p>
            <h4>Why do we need this application ?</h4>
                <p>
                    In data integration, we want to get data to solve some business problem,but no one single database has all the data we need. 
                    We could create a warehouse, which contains a copy of the important data from each of the databases,
                    and then write our software to run on top of that. Or we create a "virtual" database 
                    that looks as though it contains the data from both databases, but which in fact does not exist at all. 
                    The virtual database needs to have a schema. At the moment, someone with lots of technical expertise
                    and understanding of the relevant databases normally designs the global schema. 
                    It can look like the local schemas, or it can be completely different.  
                    The person building the mediator has to give it mappings that tell it 
                    how the things in the global schema relate to the things in the local schemas.
                    And someone has to work out in detail what all these mappings are, too.

                </p>
                <p><b><font size="3">The problem with this is:</font></b>
                    who does this difficult and time-consuming job?  
                    Who knows enough about all the databases involved and what they contain? 
                    This will be domain experts. But these people don't have the technical skills to create the schema and the mappings.
                </p>
            <h4>How does this application solve the problem above ?</h4>
                <p>
                    This application is going to try to apply <b>pay-as-you-go</b> techniques to this task: <b>the design of the global schema.</b> 
                    Instead of asking the domain experts to create the whole global schema up front in one go,
